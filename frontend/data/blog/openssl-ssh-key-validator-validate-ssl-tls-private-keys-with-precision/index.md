# openssl-ssh-key-validator: Validate SSL/TLS Private Keys with Precision


If you’ve ever tried to debug an SSL/TLS private key issue, you know how painful it can be. Silent failures, generic errors, and tools that don’t tell you why something’s wrong. That’s exactly why I built openssl-ssh-key-validator. 




This package gives developers a fast, reliable way to validate PEM-encoded private keys—RSA, EC, DSA, or PKCS#8—with detailed error messages and exact failure locations.




Why It Matters




Key validation shouldn't be a black box. With this tool, you get:





Format-aware checks (PKCS#1, PKCS#8, etc.)



Header/footer integrity validation



Base64 integrity checks



Detection of corrupted or malformed keys



Precise error types, with line/character positions




It’s lightweight, zero-dependency (except for node-forge), and made for serious developers who want transparent feedback when things go wrong.




Install it





```
npm add openssl-ssh-key-validator
# or
yarn add openssl-ssh-key-validator
```




Usage





```
import { validatePrivateKey } from "openssl-ssh-key-validator";

const pem = `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...your key...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`;

const result = validatePrivateKey(pem);

if (result.isValid) {
  console.log("Valid key!");
} else {
  console.error(result.message);
}
```




Summary




openssl-ssh-key-validator helps you catch SSL/TLS key issues early with clear, structured error reporting. Built for reliability. Designed for developers. Leave a star on a github or check out npm.
