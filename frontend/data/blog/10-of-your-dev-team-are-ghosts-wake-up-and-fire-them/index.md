# 10% of Your Dev Team Are Ghosts - Wake Up and Fire Them


You read that right. Nearly one in ten software engineers on your payroll might be doing almost nothing. A recent Stanford study showed that about 9-10% of developers contribute so little you can’t even spot them on a team radar. They clock in, collect a paycheck, and disappear into the digital abyss. These are the ghost engineers — slackers hidden behind Git commits that barely move the needle.




How did we get here? Remote work exploded over the past few years, and with it came a hidden problem: out-of-sight, out-of-mind engineers. Some of them have convinced their managers they’re productive by making token code changes or performing superficial tasks. Meanwhile, the rest of the team carries the real workload. As a hiring manager, every ghost engineer is a burning hole in your budget and a festering morale killer for your top performers.




I know managers hate this. You interview candidates, check their resumes and GitHub stars, only to find out months later that your “rockstar hire” is MIA half the time. You pay handsomely for senior talent, but a silent minority drains your resources. It’s infuriating - and it’s on you to fix it.




Why ghost engineers thrive





Loose remote policies. If you don’t enforce daily standups, code reviews, or measurable goals, slackers slip through the cracks.



Vague performance metrics. When you measure “bushels of code” instead of impact, you reward quantity over quality.



Fear of confrontation. Managers avoid tough conversations, hoping poor performers will “self-correct.” Spoiler alert: they rarely do.




No more excuses. It’s time to shine a spotlight on every member of your team.




Signs you’re funding ghost engineers





Sparse Git history. A real developer pushes code, comments on tickets, and participates in pull requests. Ghosts leave ghostly footprints.





Absent in meetings. They skip standups or drone on without substance.





Zero peer feedback. Peers can’t point to any valuable contributions.





Unfinished work. They hug “in progress” tickets like a security blanket.




If these red flags ring true, you’re likely sponsoring ghosts.




How to exorcise your codebase?





Track real impact. Ditch lines‑of‑code metrics. Measure features delivered, bugs squashed and user feedback. Reward engineers who move the product forward.



Mandate daily check‑ins. Use brief status updates or async standups. If someone disappears for days, alarm bells should ring.



Enforce code reviews. No PR goes unreviewed. Ensure every line of code earns scrutiny and approval.



Hold weekly demos. Ask each engineer to show what they’ve built. Ghosts choke when they can’t present real work.



Escalate quickly. Missed deadlines demand immediate action—no more letting mediocrity linger.




Yes, it’s uncomfortable and you’ll ruffle feathers. But every penny reclaimed from ghost salaries funds genuine innovation—and keeps your best talent motivated.




A wake‑up call to hiring managers

You’re under siege from underperformers hidden in home offices across the globe. Every ghost engineer corrodes your culture, drags down morale and steals budget that should fuel growth. When you next evaluate your team, ask: am I paying for real value, or for a ghost story?




It’s not enough to hire “top talent” and hope for the best. Demand accountability. Spot the ghosts, confront them and purge them from your process. Only then will you build a lean, high‑output team that dazzles stakeholders and leaves competitors in the dust.






Final verdict




Ghost engineers aren’t a myth — they’re a nightmare for modern engineering teams. If you’ve ignored this issue, congratulations: you’re bankrolling inefficiency. But it’s not too late. Audit your team, tighten your processes and banish those freeloaders once and for all.




Your product roadmap — and your bottom line — will thank you.
