# Has Reddit Been Actually Sold to an AI Company?


No reputable news source reports that Reddit was sold to an AI company. Instead, recent coverage focuses on data-licensing agreements rather than any change of ownership. Reuters (Feb 2024) reported Reddit struck a contract to license its content to Alphabet’s Google for AI training – about $60 million per year​. Another report (via Bloomberg) said Reddit signed a similar $60M-per-year deal with an unnamed large AI company​. These deals came as Reddit was preparing to go public (it filed for an IPO valued around $6.4B)​, not being acquired by any buyer.




Reddit’s official announcements frame such partnerships positively. A Feb 2024 Reddit blog called the Google deal an “expanded partnership” to make content easier to discover and to allow Google to use Reddit’s Data API (including to train models)​. The post emphasized that existing API rules still forbid commercial use of content without permission​. In other words, Reddit says it is providing structured access to public posts, not transferring ownership.








IMPACT




Everyday users




Public Reddit posts can now feed into AI training pipelines. Users were not individually asked for permission, raising questions about privacy and consent​. Rights groups warn that reusing user content without clear consent can be problematic. (Reddit notes that its API covers public data, but regulators like the FTC are examining whether the practice is “unfair or deceptive”​.)




Artists and creators




People who contribute art, writing or other creative content fear their work might be consumed by AI models without attribution or pay. Experts note that large-scale scraping of creative content is “rife... with potential copyright issues,” as creators have alleged use of their work without permission​. The licensing deals have intensified debates about copyright and fair compensation in AI training.




Data privacy & user rights




So far, these agreements focus on public posts (not private data). Nevertheless, issues remain about control over one’s data. Tech commentators note licensing user-generated content for AI has raised privacy and fairness concerns​. The FTC’s letter specifically asked about “sale, licensing, or sharing” of user content​. Reddit says it engaged in no unfair practice​, but communities are watching how consent and data rights are handled.




Platform and investors




These data deals are lucrative: Reddit projects roughly $203M in revenue from AI licensing over the next few years​. This new income stream may help the company and its IPO valuation, but it could also undermine trust if users feel their contributions are being monetized without benefit.




Reactions and Commentary




Industry analysts note that tech firms are keen to obtain “clean” licensed data for AI and avoid legal challenges from indiscriminate web scraping​. Online, many users reacted with skepticism or anger. As one commentator put it: “whatever you write… might be fed into AI models… and while the platform… gets paid for that, you aren’t”​. Rights and privacy advocates emphasize that, even with licensing fees, issues of user consent and compensation must be addressed.




Conclusion




In summary, Reddit has not been sold to any AI company; credible reports describe data-licensing deals, not an acquisition. However, these deals have triggered debate about data privacy, copyright, and user rights. Regulators and experts are already scrutinizing the practice​. Going forward, Reddit and its community will need to navigate how to balance innovation and monetization with respect for user content and expectations.
